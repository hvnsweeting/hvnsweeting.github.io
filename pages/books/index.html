Review: The first half is repeatitive things from <code>Sapien</code> book - which is sure 5/5. The remaining discusses religions such as liberalism, communism, democracy, humanism, dataism and list out future scenarious are more interesting.

Review: A mind changing book, a eye-opening way to reason about life that it is unpredictable, and how was it much harder to look back and find cause than guessing future.

Review: My first ever book in Harry Potter series. I expected much more as known this as top rated sci-fi series in human history. A bit boring at first half but becomes better toward the end. Except the very end part, the whole story is pretty "dry", emotionless.  I was amazed how easy is it to read this whole book without a single time looking up word in dictionary. Finished in about 8 hours, spreading 4 days, it is good enough for 4.5/5.

Review: nội dung u ám, phần dịch có thể đã làm giảm độ hay của tác phẩm, khi đọc đến gần trăm trang mới hiểu "người hiến" là người được nhân bản vô tính để thu hoạch nội tạng.

Review: ngoài câu chuyện chính nói lên sự vất vả và bất công của các bác sĩ công (và ngành y) khá "mở mắt" cho người đọc (1 bác sĩ công phục vụ hàng trăm người 1 ca so với bác sĩ viện tư phục vụ 5 10 người, rõ ràng không thể luôn tươi cười chăm sóc tỉ mỉ như nhau). Phần còn lại không thực sự hấp dẫn và nhiều phần lặp lại.

Review: the longest book of 937 pages I have read, for ~5 months (not consecutive, but ~30pages/1hour per day). It took first 1-200 pages to learn the world, new words (math, avout, fraa, suur, extramurous, jeejah, bullshyte...), then a wild adventure to the cosmos... It's hard science, with math, quantum physics, parallel world but readable. Interesting ideas but not mind blowing twist like the three-body problem. A book in 2008 predicted the Internet (called Reticulum) of 2023 with full of AI generated content (ChatGPT) is impresive.

Review: what would a novel about when a Martian visit Earth (and raised by Earth people)? it's not same survival story like "The martians" novel/movie, but a great questions about human, religions, faith. The writing is funny, the plot is attractive. Much more humorous than many other sci-fi. Oh and this is the source of the word "grok" - which is very popular in tech people. "Grok" is to drink, do you grok?  figuratively means "to comprehend", "to love", and "to be one with".
